- Hello, I'm Conrad Williams (@PopGen33). 
- I'm a PhD student currently studying phylogenetics/systematics. 
- I also have worked on population genetics projects in the past, notably for my Master's.
- I've written many scripts in Python and R, but I haven't done a good job of getting those online,
- so I'm trying to change that. I haven't used GitHub (or git) much, so please have patience while I 
- learn how to use these tools. I'm always open to advice and criticism, so feel free.
